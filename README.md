Batuca침칩n is a project done at BAU Barcelona, for the final project of the M치ster en Innovaci칩n Audiovisual y Entornos Interactivo 
by Adriana Mora, Berenice Alamo, Leticia Souza and Ramiro Macedo.

In this repository you will find the open source code for our whole project.
We have the Pure Data file with the respective OSC messages for our Resolume Arena File.
We also added our Processing code used with a Kinect that allows us to track position and send OSC message for Pure Data.


Special thanks for 

Diego Suarez for the Processing Kinect Cenital Camera code.
And Xavi Manzares for the Pure Data OSC Code.

All other are credited on their respective files.
